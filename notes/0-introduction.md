# Introduction

In this case study we're going to implement a simple spreadsheet that runs inside the browser. The project will consist of the following steps:

- creating a representation for arithemtic expressions
- creating a regular expression library to parse expressions (convert them from strings to the representation we created in the previous step)
- extending our arithmetic expression language to include references to spreadsheet cells
- wiring everything we've built into the spreadsheet framework given in this project


Along the way we will get a lot of practice with core programming strategies:

- algebraic data types;
- structural recursion;
- generic types; and
- sequencing operations.
